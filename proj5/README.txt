The main (4).py file has all of the code for parts 1 and 2 that I needed to get the images I have on my website. I had to delete the image folder
since it took up too much space to upload the folder, so that would first need to be implemented to run the code. Parts 3 and 4 were done 
of google colab so they are in another file, untitled0.py. The paths to the folder setup would need to be matched to get the same results that
I had. I could not completely finish part 4 because I ran out of GPU on 4 different Google accounts unfortunately and I did not have enough memory
to get some of the results.
