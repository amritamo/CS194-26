File Desciption:

The main.py file has code that I wrote on VSCode, which was used to produce the results for the image 
sharpening section as well as the hybrid images (does not include code for FFT frequency analysis)

The align_image_code.py file has the staff code that I did not make changes to. 

The Project 2 CS 194-26.py file has the code I wrote using jupyter notebook, which includes the code for 
section 1, fun with filters, the FFT frequency analysis for the hybrid images, as well as all of 
section 2.3 and 2.4 (multiresolution blending)
