File contents
main.py contains the naive image alignment optimization methods, as well as the image pyramid function. It also contains the auto-contrast
feature and auto white balance. To use the auto contras feature, I implemented this in OpenCV, whereas the rest of the code is 
using skimage, so the skimage code for reading in, writing, and showing the image will need to be commented out, and the cv2 specific code
should be uncommented.
