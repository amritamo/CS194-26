In this project, I explored manipulating different images through their frequencies and adding filters. I first tested how we can implement the finite difference operators and testing different thresholds for edge detection. We applied the Gaussian blurring filter for various different use cases including finding edge images, image sharpening, producing high and low frequency images, as well as multiresolution blending.
